# UFO-srTHG-2020
Spectra.m: plot the measured spectrum of the laser we use, plot the THG spectra of seven different samples, and calculate and plot the corresponding nonlinear susceptibility of each sample. (For Figure 2a-2h.)

Mice_In_Vivo_pseudo_color.m: show image of tumor microenvironment of a formed melanoma tumor on a mouse model with pseudo color, and plot its pseudo-colored image strength distribution of each channel. (For Figure 3b and 3c.)

srTHGM.m: program for calculating saturation oxygenation of in vivo red blood cells for mice and human, based on the calculation result of calibration from ex vivo red blood cells and collagen of mice and human. (Figure 4b, 4e, 4h, 5a-5j and Supplementary figures.)


## Instructions for programs

### System requirements

software: MATLAB,R2018b,64-bit  
computer system: Windows 10 Enterprise,x64

### Demo and Instruction for Use

#### Instructions to run on data

#### For “Spectra.m”:
(i) First download “ Spectra ” file, which includes demo data and codes.  
(ii) Start MATLAB and run " Spectra.m ".  
(iii) You will get Figure 2a-2h.  

#### For “Mice_In_Vivo_pseudo_color.m”:
(i) First download “ Mice_in_vivo_pseudo_color ” file, which includes demo data and codes.  
(ii) Start MATLAB and run " Mice_In_Vivo_pseudo_color.m ".  
(iii) You will get Figure 3b-3c.  

#### For “srTHGM.m”:
(i) First download “ srTHGM ” file, which includes demo data and codes.  
(ii) Start MATLAB and run " srTHGM.m ".  
(iii) When asked the demo data, ‘mice’, ‘human’ or ‘all’, enter the number of the part you want to analyze.  
(iv) If you choose ‘mice’, you will get Figure 4b, 4e and 4h;  
if you choose ‘human’, you will get Figure 5e, 5f and 5h;   
if you choose ‘exvivo_human’, you will get Figure 5a-5d, 5g, 5i-5j and Supplementary figures.  

#### Expected output: As indicated in Instruction

#### Expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer
It takes less than 10 minutes for each code running.
